	<p>
	This week we've been working on a custom lighting System for the Quattrocycle,
	a four wheeled, family quad-cycle with independent gearing and suspension.

   The BridgerSoc Lighting System is on it's way to good folks at <a href="https://www.chatnbike.com/">Chat 'n Bike</a> 
   and we can't wait to see what it looks like once it is installed on one of the Quattrocycles!

  <h1>Pattern&#8203;Agents: Quattrocycle Update</h1>
  <p>
  We just received a video of the BridgerSoc installed on the Quattrocycle :

   </div>

  <p>
  The BridgerSoc has several different operating modes, and one of them allowed the unit to be operated from switches to control the lights.
  We've used that operating mode to enable people to make their own bicycle lighting using the BridgerSoc.
