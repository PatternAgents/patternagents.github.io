<p>
This is the example project for the Touch Widgets Library How-To, and in this how-to example, 
we have made a small Arduino Form Factor Shield/Board that includes a few different touch widgets,
and will be compatible with a number of different Arduino boards.

<p>
We will use the Arduino pins A0 as a select button, and A1-A5 pins for a five (5) button linear slider. 
This is a simple (arbitrary) example, but will serve to explain all the steps necessary for you to make your own designs.
