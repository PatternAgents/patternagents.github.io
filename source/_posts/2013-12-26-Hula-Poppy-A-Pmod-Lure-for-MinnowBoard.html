  Hula_Poppy lets you connect Peripheral Modules (Pmods) to the Intel MinnowBoard. Peripheral Modules are available for Wi-Fi, BlueTooth,
  SDCard, RS-232, RS-485, CAN-Bus, LCD display, ADC controllers, DAC controllers, Digital Potentiometers and much more.

<h3>PatternAgents Hula Poppy Introduction :</h3>
<p>
The Hula Poppy is a simple expansion board for the Intel MinnowBoard that allows for the use of the dozens of Peripheral Module (Pmod)
boards available form Digilent Inc, Maxim, PatternAgents, and many others. 
</p>
<p>
Here at PatternAgents, we thought that it would be great idea to show people how to use our new "Boards" library for Eagle,
which includes MinnowBoard Lure boards, as well as other small form factor boards, like the Arduino. Using our "Boards" library
as well as our "Interface" library (which includes Pmods, Uext and other interfaces) we created the Hula Poppy board design,
to give MinnowBoard users access to the wide variety of existing Peripheral Modules (Pmods).
The new "Hula Poppy" from PatternAgents will let you access different Pmods types that can be connected using the MinnowBoard's native
I2C, SPI, UART, GPIO, or SDIO interfaces.

<p>
The <a href="http://www.digilentinc.com/Pmods/Digilent-Pmod_%20Interface_Specification.pdf">Peripheral Modules (Pmod) standard</a> was developed by 
<a href="http://www.digilentinc.com/Products/Catalog.cfm?NavPath=2,401&Cat=9">Digilent Inc.</a>, and anyone can use it as long as they adhere to
the <a href="http://www.digilentinc.com/Pmods/licensing.cfm">Digilent Licensing Agreement</a>.
<p>
There are already a great number of Peripheral Modules (Pmods) available, such as this selection of boards from <a href="http://www.maximintegrated.com/products/evkits/fpga-modules/">Maxim</a>. Maxim is using the Pmod standard
for demonstration and evalution modules for their new products, making them very simple to adopt and evaluate.

<p>
<a href="http://www.digilentinc.com/Products/Catalog.cfm?NavPath=2,401&Cat=9">Digilent Inc.</a>, was the creator
of the Pmod standard, and they originally intended them to be used to expand their FPGA boards, and robotic controllers
in a simple, user friendly way. Digilent has a great variety of existing Peripheral Modules available for Wi-Fi, BlueTooth,
SDCard, RS-232, RS-485, CAN-Bus, LCD display, ADC controllers, DAC controllers, Digital Potentiometers and much more.
Below are a few examples, like a <br>GPS receiver :

</p>
<p>
Or a <br> Zigbee RF Module :

</p>
<p>
or Stepper Motor and <br> H-Bridge Controllers :
 <a href="http://www.digilentinc.com/Products/Detail.cfm?NavPath=2,401,1163&Prod=PMOD-DHB1"><img src="{{site.url.images}}/projects/Hula_Poppy/PmodDHB1-obl-400.png" alt="Digilent H-Bridge" title="Digilent H-Bridge"/></a>
</p>
<p>
And we even support the High Speed MinnowBoard SDIO port, for SDCard and <br>SDIO peripherals :
 <a href="http://www.digilentinc.com/Products/Detail.cfm?NavPath=2,401,513&Prod=PMOD-SD"><img src="{{site.url.images}}/projects/Hula_Poppy/PmodSD-400.png" alt="Digilent SDIO" title="Digilent SDIO"/></a>
</p>
<p>
The PatternAgents "Hula Poppy" lure supports all these and much more, and it is a completely Open Source Hardware
project. You can download the PCB gerber files from our Github Repo (listed below), and you can order you own 
Printed Circuit boards from <a href="http://www.oshpark.com/">OSHpark</a>. The project was designed to be easily hand-soldered.
We are also starting talks with a contract manufacturer to bring you fully assembled boards as well.
