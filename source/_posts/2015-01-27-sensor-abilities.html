<p>There are several efforts underway to define and codify sensor abilities and parameters,
both in normal operation and in manufacturing testing. It can also be difficult to change sensor
elements, either due to new products becoming available, or the obsolescence of existing models,
due to the amount of software changes involved.
In this article, I'll discuss some of the evolving standards efforts underway, 
and what that means for trying to keep up with the latest sensor technology.
