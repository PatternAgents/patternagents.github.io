<p>
  The I2C_Devicetree reference design project uses a programmable System-on-Chip (SoC) with a Cortex-M0 CPU,  in a small 28 Pin TSSOP package,
to emulate an I2C EEPROM using the FLASH memory of the SoC, which creates an "intelligent memory" device. The I2C_Devicetree reference design project is intended to make it easier for people to create their own custom expansion boards for Beaglebone, Raspberry Pi and other platforms
that require the use of a Devicetree EEPROM for automatic product identification, pin mapping, and configuration on the Linux Operating System.
The I2C_Devicetree reference design project also includes an I2C I/O Expander to provide extra GPIO pins that are I2C controlled.

   The I2C_Devicetree reference design project creates an "intelligent memory" device 
by using a microprocessor to emulate a "dumb" I2C EEPROM memory chip. New peripherals
for small computers based on the Linux Operating System, such as Beagebone Black "Capes",
Raspberry Pi "Hats", and others require a small I2C memory device to be included that
configuration data about that peripheral. This configuration "meta-data" includes things
such as the product make, model, and serial number, and more.
