<b>thingSoC</b> defines a physical, hardware socket system for inter-operable printed circuit boards,
with a data centric firmware model for automatic device discovery, and a software API for interacting with the system.
</p>
<!-- more -->
<p>
<b>thingSoC</b> provides a vendor neutral and device agnostic socket standard, 
using a virtual hardware socket definition; so you are not locked in to any proprietary solutions.
This means that the IoT applications you develop can be easily migrated 
without having to re-write your software.
<p>
As many of you know, we've been working on the thingSoC socket concept for quite a while now,
and it is finally approaching it's first official release.
