  <h1>PatternAgents Privacy Policy</h1>
  
  <p>
    PatternAgents values your business and respects your privacy.
    We have taken every effort to ensure the privacy and security of all your transactions with us. Any credit card information, or other personal data that you provide during the order process will be secured with the highest levels of confidentiality using our PCI compliant shopping cart.
  </p>
  
  <h3>Secure Shopping Cart</h3>
  <p>
    All orders placed at the PatternAgents Web Site are encrypted using SSL technology, so that your transactions are secured and protected. Using SSL for both the client and the server, any information sent via the Internet will arrive through an SSL-enabled browser. The majority of web browsers today are equipped with SSL technology by default. To insure that your connection is secure when filling out the order form, please check for the padlock symbol in the bottom border of your browser window, when using our shopping cart checkout. The padlock symbol should be visible and show the lock in a locked position, which indicates that you have an SSL https://patternagents.github.io/encrypted connection with our servers.
  </p>
  
  <p class="important">
    Note: Plain Text Email is not encrypted and is not a secure means of sending credit card information. Please place all orders through the order form. Do not attempt to email an order to us using your credit card information.
  </p>
  
  <h3>Online Privacy Policy</h3>
  <p>
    PatternAgents will always respect the privacy of our customers and vendors, 
    and will never collect any personally identifying information without your permission. We have never and will never sell your personal information or your email address to anyone. All of our email communications with you will be only at your request via an Opt-In email format, and the email sign-up process requires your consent via a provided return email link.
  </p>
  <p>
    There may be situations when PatternAgents is legally bound to turn over your data under a court order or a search warrant. If this situation ever occurs, we will work with the appropriate law enforcement agency to do everything
    that we can possibly do to limit the amount of information released to that which is specifically required under court order. If you are a representative of a valid law enforcement body, please see our <a href="/policies/legal/law.html">Law Enforcement Policy</a> page for more information.
  </p>
  <p>
    Any information that you provide to PatternAgents while placing an order with us will be handled according to the policy in effect at the time that the order is placed. From time to time we may change our company policies, and any changes made will be announced using these policy statements. Concerned customers should review these statements for changes when revisiting our site.
    Customers also have the ability to Opt-In to any policy change announcements via our email notification system.

  <h3>Cookie Basics</h3>
  <p>
A cookie is a small text file that is stored in your web browser that allows PatternAgents or a third party to recognize you using a unique identifier.

Who sets them: First-party cookies are set by PatternAgents. Third-party cookies are set by companies other than PatternAgents, such as analytics providers and advertisers.

What they do: "Essential" cookies enable services we offer. "Non-essential" cookies help us understand how our services are being used (i.e., analytics) and deliver advertisements. Some cookies may track you across multiple websites you visit (including ones not operated by us) to help deliver advertisements that may be relevant to you.

How long they last: Cookies may be either "session" or "persistent." A session cookie expires (i.e., is deleted) when you close your browser. A persistent cookie remains until it expires or you delete the cookies via your browser settings. Expiration dates are set in the cookies themselves and may vary in length, depending on the purpose of the cookie.

  <h3>Cookies Found on PatternAgents Service</h3>

Third parties set cookies for both essential and non-essential purposes including analytics (e.g., Google Analytics) and advertising (e.g., Google DoubleClick for Publishers).

PatternAgents video player: PatternAgents’s embeddable video player uses first-party cookies that we consider essential to the video player experience.

We have no control over third-party websites or the cookies they set.

<h3>Similar Technologies</h3>
We use technologies that resemble cookies to help track user activities and preferences. For example, we may use web beacons (tiny graphics with a unique identifier embedded on web pages or emails) to track your activities and communicate with cookies. You cannot opt out of web beacons used on webpages, but you can limit their use by opting out of the cookies they interact with. You can opt out of web beacons used in emails by setting your email client to render emails in text mode only.

<h3>Mobile Apps</h3>
Our apps (e.g., for iOS, tvOS, Android, and Roku) do not use cookies, but may use tracking technologies to, for example, authenticate you as a registered user, allow you to use the app’s features, and help us understand how our apps are being used. You cannot opt out of these mobile tracking technologies, but you may delete your apps and use the web versions of our services instead.
