24) Q: Schedule and "going live" - we are almost there I think.
       A few minor tweaks listed below, and we can call it good...

23) Q: Ecwid "Add-to-Bag" image not in color scheme.
    A: Custom /img/ecwid/buy_now.png button created with site color scheme.
       (should the text be "white" to better match "subscribe" button above?

22) Q: Update Github projects to match new image URL (/img/project)
    A: Done and tested.

21) Q: "names" are confused many places and need to be "normalized" 
       (i.e. tinysoc, tiny-soc, etc. -> Need to normalize to "TinySoc" everywhere...)

20) Q: Comments sometimes "ride up" on the page if there is not Ecwid buy widget.
       How to fix this on pages with no store link?
       (i.e. http://www.patternagent.com/projects/tiny-soc.html )
    A: Fixed by putting the bottom image(s) into a table, comments are below the table now.
    A: Marion added a "break" to fix this in the CSS...

19) Q: Turn Images on "Projects" page into links, people click in the image, not the link...
    A: Done and tested.

18) Q: Add a local signup page form, rather than use MailChimps - 
       basic form type will work and will match the site better stylistically...
    A: Done. It's Fugly, but it functions.

17) Q: Add a secure contact form. Needs to be secure and include a Captcha at minimum.
       I've used www.emailmeform.com before with good success, will also look at google "forms".
    A: Google forms was too wierd for a contact form, might be good for a survey though...
       Settled on EmailMeForm for now, I know it works (4 years of use) and is secure with a Captcha...
    A: Done. It's Fugly, but it functions.

16) Q: Home page "feature" size still seems little large - vertical size
       For each product/project there are the following images generated :
       project_thumb.png  (128 x <128) <-- I think the feature should use this image to reduce size...
       project.png        (320 x <320)
       project_model.png  (320 x <320)  Isometric view
       project_top.png    (>512 x >512) (also _bot, and _iso  - highest resolution)

       Q: Was able to reduce the "whitespace" on the Feature slightly, removing the button.
          (google analytics show people click on the "image" anyway...)

15) Q: Add Disqus to project pages.
       I think it would useful to display the disqus widget on these pages.
    A: Done and tested.

14) Q: Font loading time - sometimes google font load is slow, should we host the fonts locally?
       Fonts loaded locally, I need to figure out how to link to them...
    A: After reading about this it seems google will likely be faster for most people - issue closed.

13) Q: Transparent Images - they look better, how do we drop the white background?
    A: Done and tested, looks better IMHO...

12) Q: Image priority. Currently not sure where an image will render vertically.
       Is there a way to specify valign "top/middle/bottom" for images?
       Or a priority (high, med, low?) (i.e. high priority first, etc.)
    A: Fixed by putting the image(s) into a table now.


11) Q: Are we still using any plugins? Without contact.php are we now "github safe"?
       It would be very useful to be able to redirect the site to github if the server ever goes down hard...

10) Q: pushing the footer to the page bottom.
       I have some ideas, but not sure about implementation.

9)  Q: changing "Products" page to 3 column layout.
       I think it would useful to display the twitter/disqus widget on these pages.
       I think I know how to do this properly myself, but we should talk about it.
    A: Done. Created a layout/projects.html
       Removed the (redundent) projects list in the first column, kept the news. Added Twitter/Disqus.

8)  Q: Future-proofing nav menu - how hard to add dropdowns for future expansion?
       (i.e.  News  -> Top News
              News  -> Press Releases
	      About -> Staff
	      About -> Openings
	      Support -> Customer Service
	      Support -> Technical Support
	etc.)
	This is very low priority right now, but I'm interested in Future-proofing for later. 

7)  Q: Need to add two more mailchimp lists (i.e. patternagents_press & patternagents_prerelease)
       These will be for a separate press release mailing list, and a product prerelease mailing list.
       I expect I will need to add new widgets for each list (unless they can be templated in_config.yml)
    A: Done. This was done using the new "groups" feature of Mailchimp rather than separate lists.

6)  Q: How to insert varibles (i.e. page_slug) into JavaScript Variables?
       Need to insert the page_slug for per page discussions into the disqus.js widget
       I think this is can be done with the yaml front matter added to disqus.js and each page.

4)  Q: nav like so? http://webdesign.tutsplus.com/tutorials/htmlcss-tutorials/a-simple-responsive-mobile-first-navigation/
    A: The current navigation looks great, works well at all tested resolutions.

3)  Q: make sure the e-mail signup works, maybe rewrite the mail configure page
    A: Tested and working.

2)  Q: possible color scheme:  http://colorschemedesigner.com/#3M21Tn1knw0w0
    A: Looks wonderful, it is adopted.

1)  Q: e-mail comments for blog: https://github.com/mpalmer/jekyll-static-comments
    A: Going with Disqus instead, a less-time consuming UI to manage (allows for moderator roles) ...
